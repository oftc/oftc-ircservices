                        oftc-ircservices INSTALL file

$Id$

This document will tell you how to install oftc-ircservices onto your machine
and hopefully get them up and running with minimal fuss. 

Installation of oftc-ircservices is reasonably straight forward.  It is
distributed using standard GNU autoconf processes, so should be similar to
most other GNU software you have used.

To this end, to get started, do:

./configure (see ./configure --help for options that you can tune)
make
make install

This will install the services binary and support files in the location you
have specified(or your default prefix if you havent specified one).

Once installation if complete you will need to configure services by editing
etc/services.conf.  Use example.conf as a guide.

Now, depending on which database platform you are using, you will need to set
up your database tables.  Firstly, create the database you will use, then
import the scripts in sql/ for the database type you are using.  E.g. if you
are using postgres, you will need to import sql/nickserv-pgsql.sql
sql/chanserv-pgsql.sqlp and sql/operserv-pgql.sql.  Once this is done
services.conf should be updated to the database you created.
