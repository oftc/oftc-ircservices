  - remove stuff
    svn remove trunk/genlang.rb
    svn remove trunk/include/setup.h.in
    svn remove trunk/install-sh
    find trunk -type f -name Makefile.in -print0 | xargs -0 svn remove
  - add stuff
    find trunk -type f -name Makefile.am -print0 | xargs -0 svn add
    svn add trunk/acinclude.m4
    svn add trunk/AUTHORS
    svn add trunk/ChangeLog

    svn add trunk/README
    svn add trunk/TODO
  - move stuff
    svn move trunk/LICENSE trunk/COPYING

- consider authoring trunk/INSTALL; it is automatically added by automake but
  if there are specific instructions that a user should know about, then we
  should have an INSTALL file of our own
- consider converting from libdl to libltdl
